## STEPS PERFORMED :
Designing a 4-stage pipelined processor with basic instructions like ADD, SUB, and LOAD involves creating a pipeline with Fetch, Decode, Execute, and Write Back stages.

## SIMULATION REPORT :
  In this simple pipelined processor design, the following stages and operations are demonstrated:

  Fetch (IF): Instructions are fetched from the instruction memory.

  Decode (ID): Instructions are decoded, and operands are read from the register file.

  Execute (EX): ALU performs arithmetic operations.

  Memory (MEM): Data is read from or written to data memory.

  Write Back (WB): Results are written back to the register file.

  Running the simulation, you will see how each stage operates in parallel, demonstrating the pipeline functionality. You can expand this design and testbench to 
  include more instructions and more complex operations.
